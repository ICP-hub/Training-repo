## 🌐 **ICP Projects** (Rust, Dfinity, Internet Computer Protocol)

### 🏗 Counter dApp
A **lightweight decentralized application** built using **Rust and Dfinity** on **ICP**. This project allows users to increment and decrement a counter value on the **blockchain** while demonstrating **state persistence** in **canister smart contracts**.

### ✅ To-Do List
A decentralized **task management application** designed using **Rust and Dfinity**. This dApp enables users to:
- **Add, update, and remove** to-do items
- **Persist data** on the **Internet Computer**
- Experience **scalability** with **ICP’s canister architecture**

## ⚡ **Solana Projects** (Rust, Anchor Framework, Solana Blockchain)

### ⭐ Building a Favorites Program
A decentralized app that enables users to **favorite items** stored securely on the **Solana blockchain**.

### 🗳 Creating a Voting Application
A **trustless voting system** built on **Solana**, ensuring **transparency, immutability, and decentralization**.

### 🔗 Integrating Blinks and Actions
A project exploring **Solana Blinks** and **on-chain actions** for **interactive decentralized applications**.

### 📝 Building a CRUD Application
An application demonstrating **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations** using **Solana smart contracts**.

### 🎟 Creating a Token
A project that showcases **minting and managing custom SPL tokens** using **Solana’s token program**.

### 🖼 Creating an NFT
A **Metaplex-based NFT minting** project that enables users to create **Solana NFTs** with metadata integration.

### 🔄 Building a Swap Program
A **decentralized exchange (DEX)** project that implements **token swaps** on **Solana’s blockchain**.

### ⏳ Creating a Token Vesting App
A **token vesting contract** that allows for **scheduled token releases** over time to designated recipients.

### 🎰 Building a Token Lottery
A **fully decentralized lottery system** built on **Solana**, ensuring **provable fairness** and **randomized token-based draws**.

---

## ⛓ **Solidity Projects**

### ⚡ Secure and Re-Entrancy Voting System
A Solidity-based **secure voting system** preventing **re-entrancy attacks**, ensuring **fair and tamper-proof elections**.

### 📜 dApp Development
Development of decentralized applications (**dApps**) using **Solidity and Ethereum smart contracts**.
